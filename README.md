### The function RoundViaDummy

Small count rounding of necessary inner cells (Heldal, 2017) are performed so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published (publishable cells) are rounded. This is equivalent to changing micro data since frequencies of unique combinations are changed. Thus, additivity and consistency are guaranteed.
This is performed by an algorithm inspired by partial least squares regression (Langsrud and Heldal, 2018).
